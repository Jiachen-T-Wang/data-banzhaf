# Data Banzhaf: A Robust Data Valuation Framework for Machine Learning

By [Jiachen T. Wang](https://tianhaowang.netlify.app/) and [Ruoxi Jia](https://ruoxijia.info/). 

This repository provides an implementation of the paper [Data Banzhaf: A Robust Data Valuation Framework for Machine Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15466) accepted at [AISTATS 2023](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/) as oral presentation. We propose a robust data valuation method, Data Banzhaf, which is powerful at capturing the importance of data points **at the presence of stochasticity in the learning algorithm**.


## Requirements 

The code is tested with Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.12.1. The complete list of required packages are available in `requirement.txt', and can be installed with `pip install -r requirement.txt'. The code should be compatible with other versions of packages.
