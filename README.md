## Data Banzhaf: A Robust Data Valuation Framework for Machine Learning

This repository provides an implementation of the paper [Data Banzhaf: A Robust Data Valuation Framework for Machine Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15466) accepted at [AISTATS 2023](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/) as oral presentation. We propose a robust data valuation method, Data Banzhaf, which is powerful at capturing the importance of data points **at the presence of stochasticity in the learning algorithm**.

More detailed instructions for running the code will be available soon.
